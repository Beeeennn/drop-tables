Peak AI hackathon data science project

This project anaylises the sales and profit from a group of data by grouping the products into categories and sub categories, allowing you to see the most profitiable product. As well, you can anaylise the data before, during and after a marketing campain to see how effective it was. You can also see purchasing patterns of different customer segments. 

There is also data forcasting to predict which products will be in higher demand in the future. We coded this using a _____ method and by preparing the data beforehand. We used the train test model with a split of 80/20, meaning 80% of the data is used to train the model and 20% is used to test how acurate it is.

This project is useful because it will allow a bussiness to see which products are the most profitable, how effect marketing campains are, purcashing patterns and a prediction for which products will be in demand in the future.

The contributors to this project are Benjamin Cave, Chloe Huetson, Kirstie Tingley and Luke Armstrong.
